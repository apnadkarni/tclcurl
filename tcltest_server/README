Server for testing tclcurl
==========================

Before running the tests, create some large test files:

    % tclsh gen_test_files.tcl

and start the tclcurl nginx test server:

    % cd tcltest_server
    % ./START.nginx

To stop the nginx test server:

    % cd tcltest_server
    % ./STOP.nginx

To generate a certificate, create an ssl subdirectory and follow the
instructions here. Execute the commands in the ssl subddirectory:

Curl doesn't like self signed certificates:

    http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
    http://curl.haxx.se/mail/archive-2012-01/0052.html

Extract the server's certificate like this:

    % openssl s_client -showcerts -connect server.com:443 > certs.pem

and use it in https requests with option:

    -cainfo certs.pem

Or you can choose not to bother about all this and disable verification of the
peer and host with options:

    -sslverifypeer 0 -sslverifyhost 0

These are the equivalent of curl option -k or --insecure
